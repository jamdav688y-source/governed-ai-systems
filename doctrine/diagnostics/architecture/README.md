# Architecture

This folder describes how governed AI systems are structured.

This is not about code.
This is about:
- Control planes
- Decision boundaries
- Authority routing
- Stop mechanisms
- Audit paths
- Escalation flows

If you cannot draw the control surface of your system, you do not control it.
