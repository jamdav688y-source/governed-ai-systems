# Diagnostics

This folder contains the diagnostic system for understanding why AI, automation, and decision systems fail.

This is not about model quality.
This is about:
- Ownership
- Control
- Reversibility
- Legibility
- Incentives
- Governance

Every serious failure is a systems failure before it is a technical failure.

This layer exists to:
- Detect failure modes before incidents
- Classify failures after incidents
- Turn every failure into a permanent design constraint
