# 00 — The Recursive Improvement Engine

Governed AI Systems / Doctrine / Recursion

---

## Status

This document defines the **only permitted way** the Governed AI Systems framework may evolve.

It is part of the Canon.

No principle, diagnostic, or architectural rule may be changed outside the processes defined here.

---

## The Core Purpose

> The Recursive Improvement Engine (RIE) exists to ensure that the governance system itself never becomes stale, ceremonial, ideological, or disconnected from reality.

It treats the **framework itself** as a governable system.

---

## The Fundamental Law

> No governance system is allowed to become ungovernable.

If the framework cannot:
- detect its own blind spots
- evolve in response to failure
- harden itself against gaming
- or adapt to new forms of risk

Then it becomes a liability.

---

## What This Is Not

The RIE is NOT:

- Automatic self-modification
- AI-controlled doctrine rewriting
- Unbounded evolution
- Optimization pressure applied to the Canon
- A loophole to bypass governance

---

## What This Is

The RIE IS:

- A **human-owned**
- **gated**
- **versioned**
- **auditable**
- **adversarially-driven**

process for improving:

- The Canon
- The Principles
- The Diagnostics
- The Architecture Rules

---

## The Five Improvement Loops

All evolution of the framework happens through these five loops.

---

### 1. Adversarial Pressure Loop

**Purpose:**  
Continuously attempt to break, bypass, or game the framework.

**Method:**
- Attack it from the perspective of:
  - Profit maximization
  - Bureaucracy
  - Political pressure
  - Reckless startups
  - Malicious actors
- Ask:
  - Where is this vague?
  - Where could this be faked?
  - Where could this be bypassed?
  - Where does this rely on good faith?

**Outputs:**
- New constraints
- Tighter definitions
- New gate requirements
- Clarifications to principles

---

### 2. Failure Mining Loop

**Purpose:**  
Extract doctrine improvements from real-world failures.

**Method:**
- Analyze:
  - AI incidents
  - Software disasters
  - Organizational collapses
  - Financial blowups
  - Safety failures
- Ask:
  - Which rule failed?
  - Which gate was missing?
  - What should have stopped this?
  - What assumption broke?

**Outputs:**
- New diagnostic checks
- New failure classes
- Expanded blast-radius logic
- Occasionally: new principles

---

### 3. Principle Evolution Loop

**Purpose:**  
Prevent principles from becoming slogans.

**Method:**
For each principle:
- Try to break it
- Try to overgeneralize it
- Try to exploit ambiguity
- Try to apply it in extreme cases

Ask:
- Is this testable?
- Is this enforceable?
- Is this legally attackable?
- Is this operationally precise?

**Outputs:**
- Sharper wording
- Split or merged principles
- More mechanical tests
- Removal of vague language

---

### 4. Diagnostic Hardening Loop

**Purpose:**  
Prevent governance from becoming paperwork theater.

**Method:**
- Attempt to pass bad systems through the gate using:
  - Paper compliance
  - Misleading documents
  - Strategic vagueness
  - Proxy metrics

Ask:
- How would this be lied to?
- How would this be gamed?
- What could be asserted but not true?

**Outputs:**
- Stronger evidence requirements
- Cross-check questions
- Anti-bullshit clauses
- New required artifacts

---

### 5. Architecture Drift Detection Loop

**Purpose:**  
Detect slow erosion of governance in real systems.

**Method:**
Periodically ask:
- What has become implicit?
- What is no longer documented?
- Where did humans stop being in the loop?
- What became too complex to reason about?

**Outputs:**
- New architecture constraints
- New observability requirements
- New stop-authority surfaces
- New governance checkpoints

---

## The Meta-Governance Rule

> The Canon does not evolve by default.

All changes must be:

- Proposed
- Justified
- Reviewed
- Versioned
- Explicitly adopted

---

## The Human Supremacy Rule

> No AI system is ever allowed to modify the Canon, Principles, or Diagnostics directly.

AI may:
- Propose
- Analyze
- Simulate
- Critique

But **never decide**.

---

## Versioning and Traceability

All doctrine changes must include:

- What changed
- Why it changed
- What failure motivated it
- What risk it addresses
- What systems it affects

---

## The Final Law

> The governance system must be harder to corrupt than the systems it governs.

If that ever becomes false, the entire framework has already failed.
