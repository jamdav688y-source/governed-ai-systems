# The Ten Principles of Governed Systems

These are not best practices.

They are **survival constraints**.

Any system that violates them will eventually produce harm.

---

## 1. Authority Must Be Legible

If you cannot point to who owns the outcome, the system is already unsafe.

---

## 2. Stop Authority Must Exist

If no human can halt the system, the system is not under control.

---

## 3. Reversibility Must Be Designed

If actions cannot be undone, you are gambling with consequences.

---

## 4. Responsibility Cannot Be Distributed Away

If everyone is responsible, no one is responsible.

---

## 5. Incentives Must Be Aligned With Outcomes

If the system rewards speed over correctness, failure is guaranteed.

---

## 6. Escalation Paths Must Be Real

If escalation exists only on paper, it does not exist.

---

## 7. Observability Is Not Optional

If you cannot see what the system is doing, you are not operating it.

---

## 8. Optimization Pressure Creates Risk

Every metric creates a blind spot.

---

## 9. Autonomy Must Be Earned, Not Assumed

Capability does not imply trustworthiness.

---

## 10. No System Is Allowed to Be Irreversible by Default

Irreversibility must be a conscious, human-owned decision.
