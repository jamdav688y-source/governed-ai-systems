# The Governed Systems Diagnostic

This diagnostic is the primary gate for evaluating any AI, automation, or complex decision system.

No system is allowed to proceed to design, build, or deployment without passing through this diagnostic.

This is not a checklist.

It is a **governance instrument**.

---

## Purpose

The diagnostic exists to surface:

- Hidden authority structures
- Irreversibility
- Responsibility gaps
- Incentive misalignment
- Unsafe autonomy
- Missing stop mechanisms

---

## How It Is Used

Every proposal, system, or architecture must be forced to answer the core questions in this folder.

Answers must be:

- Explicit
- Owned by a human
- Reviewable
- Auditable

If a system cannot answer these questions clearly, it is **not allowed to proceed**.

---

## Status

This diagnostic outranks:

- Architecture
- Implementation
- Optimization
- Delivery pressure

If the diagnostic fails, the system does not ship.

No exceptions.
