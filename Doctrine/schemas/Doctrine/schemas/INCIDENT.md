# 🚨 INCIDENT.md — When Reality Disagrees With Our Decisions

> In this system, **incidents are not accidents**.  
> They are **feedback from reality**.  
> If an incident cannot be recorded, explained, and turned into a system improvement, the system is lying to itself.

## 1. Purpose

An **Incident** is a governed record of when:

- A Decision caused harm
- A system behaved unexpectedly
- An assumption proved false
- Or reality diverged from intent

Incidents exist to ensure the system:

- Learns
- Adapts
- Tightens constraints
- And never forgets its failures

## 2. Why This Exists

Most organizations fail **twice**:

1. First when something breaks
2. Then again when they **fail to institutionalize the lesson**

Without incident memory:

- The same failures repeat
- The same risks are reintroduced
- The same “surprises” happen again
- The organization becomes amnesiac

This schema exists to make that impossible.

## 3. Incident Lifecycle

Every Incident must move through:

1. **Detected** — Something went wrong
2. **Stabilized** — The damage is contained
3. **Analyzed** — Root cause is identified
4. **Attribution** — Linked to Decisions and Controls
5. **Corrected** — Fixes are implemented
6. **Institutionalized** — New rules, gates, or policies created
7. **Archived** — Preserved forever as memory

## 4. Required Fields (Canonical Schema)

Every Incident must contain:
